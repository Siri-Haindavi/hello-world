# Hello-World Repository - Assignment 1

### Hello! Welcome to my Web Design world :)

My name is __Siri Haindavi__. I have a background in ```Digital Marketing``` with five and half years of experience, primarily focused on analytics and reporting through tools like ```Google Analytics``` and ```Adobe Analytics```. While I have some familiarity with website design, my expertise mainly lies in backend reporting. I have considered taking this course as a stepping stone to understand the front-end aspects of web design.
 
My goal is to attain a high level of expertise in the core principles of web design, with a special emphasis on gaining mastery over ```HTML5``` and ```CSS3```. I intend to develop a robust skill set for creating and styling web pages, ranging from establishing interlinked web pages to incorporating visual elements like images and graphics. Furthermore, I am keen to acquire a deep understanding of industry best practices, including the creation of user-friendly navigation menus, the effective formatting of textual content, and the strategic positioning of various elements within a web layout. 

By the end of this course, _I aim to deliver web pages that not only excel in data-driven functionality but also offer a pleasing and intuitive user experience._

Thank you :)
